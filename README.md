# 🧠🔌 Virtual Reality Project for Learning Electronics & Embedded Systems

## 🎯 Overview

This project aims to create an interactive **Virtual Reality (VR)** learning environment to teach the basics of **electronics** and **embedded systems** in a fun, realistic, and safe way.  
Users can build electronic circuits, test components, program microcontrollers, and interact with the system as if they were in a real lab.
